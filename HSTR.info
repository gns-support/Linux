hstr

HSTR is a command line utility that brings improved BASH command completion from the history. It aims to make completion easier and more efficient than Ctrl-r.
Apart to the completion, history can be managed (you can remove commands that e.g. contain sensitive information like passwords) and bookmark your favorite commands.
